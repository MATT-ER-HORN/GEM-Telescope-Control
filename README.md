# GEM-Telescope-Control
Arduino program to control a homemade low-budget mount

This arduino program is to designed operate a low-budget, diy German equatorial mount (GEM) using encoders and steppers. The arduino reports its coordinates to stellarium and accepts GOTO commands from stellarium. All parts except for the worm wheels can be sourced cheaply - the goal is to be able to create a usable astrophotraphy GOTO mount for a lightweight telescope for around 100 Euros.   There are several other projects out there do something similar but none that were right for me. The initial project should be complete by july 2019.
